    <string name="intro_text">According to Dr. Aron\'s study, it\'s possible to fall in love with anyone!
    \n\nA heterosexual man and woman enter the lab through separate doors. They sit face to face and answer a series of increasingly personal questions.
    Then they stare silently into each other’s eyes for four minutes.
    \n\nThe most tantalizing detail: Six months later, two participants were married!
        \n\nAre you in?</string>
